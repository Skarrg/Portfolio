        <h2>Programmer and IT engineer who has worked in various roles in the video game
            and tech industry for over 10 years.</h2>
        <p>My path to the present is rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area, my birth place and professional home for
            almost my entire life. I majored in Physics and English at San Jose State, and the companies I worked at
            since then have deepend my love and immersion with technology.</p>
        <p>I'm currently employed at Double Fine Productions, and in my spare time I work on passion projects.
            My main expertises are Javascript, Python, Node, React, MySql, MongoDB, Perforce, Maya, Zbrush, Unreal, 
            and a host of other minor experiences.
